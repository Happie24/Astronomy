Every programmer must have an owned library of codes. They come in handy at need. Here is mine: [Day-Today Codes](https://github.com/prakashbh/day-today-codes). If you create and have a library of your own, well, you should!

### Prerequisites
* A quick revision of [C Basic](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2019/blob/master/course-notes/0-c-basics.pdf) concepts.
* You can revise your knowledge of structures through this ebook: [Structures and C](https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/644937). The book covers structures from the very basics to complex programs. 
* Basic theory notes of [Stacks, Queues and Lists](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2019/blob/master/course-notes/0-stacks-queues-lists-theory.pdf)
* [Applications](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2019/blob/master/course-notes/0-stacks-queues-lists-continued.pdf) of basic data structures
* [Implementation](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2019/blob/master/course-notes/0-stacks-queues-lists-implementation.pdf) of basic data structures

## Challenges

**Note:** Look out for All [Challenge Results](https://tinyurl.com/dsa-2019-challenges)

**Challenge 01: Essay**

One of the essential skill for a problem solver is Comprehension capability. Hence, the first challenge is an essay challenge. Read the ebook: [Design of a Programmer](https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/639609) and write an essay of 300-500 words. Your essay must not be a book review. It must be your take away thoughts. Pen down your thoughts on an A4 sheet with your name and roll number and submit it by the end of the class on **17th Aug 2019, 10.00am**. 

This is a compulsory challenge. All essays will be reviewed and graded on a scale of 1 to 35. The Challenge scorecard can be accessed here: [DOP Scorecard](https://tinyurl.com/dop-3c-2019)



**Challenge 02: Code The Philosophy**

You are given with a list of ten philosophies. You need to code a simple C program to realize it. More details in the pdf: [Code The Philosophy Challenge](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2019/blob/master/challenges/2-code-the-philosophy.pdf). Deadline is **25th August 2019, 5.00pm, Sunday**. Adhere to submission guidelines as mentioned. Use the template given to code. Fill up all the TO-DO sections. Template can be found [Here](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2019/blob/master/challenges/2-code-the-philosophy-template.c).

The top submission will receive a DSA PUDDINGA trophy. 



**Challenge 03: MAT Challenge**

Look out for the [MAT Challenge](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2019/blob/master/challenges/3-MAT-challenge.pdf). Along with students, even the course instructor will be taking up this challenge. Any student who designs and codes a better solution than course instructor scores a 100/100. More details in the supplied pdf. The submission deadline is **1 September 2019, 2.00am**. Instructors solution can be accessed [HERE](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2019/blob/master/challenges/mat-ph.c). This is a compulsory challenge evaluated for Lab 04. 



**Challenge 04: The ToH Challenge**

After 2 code challenges, we come back to a report challenge. Check out the [ToH Challenge](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2019/blob/master/challenges/4-toh-challenge.pdf). The deadline is NOW! This challenge carries 20 points. 



**Challenge 05: The 100 Challenge**

100 is an interesting number! Solve this problem that has 100 test cases - [The 100 Challenge](http://www.hackerrank.com/the-100-challenge). The contest is hosted on HackerRank and the problem was developed based on the idea given by Samsung R&D team. The contest ends on 16 Sept 2019. 100 Test Cases, 100 Points. Break a leg!



**Challenge 06: Tree Traversal Fortnight**

A fortnight worth head scrath of DFS and BFS! [Tree Traversal Fortnight](http://www.hackerrank.com/tree-traversal-fortnight) is hosted on HackerRank with 8 questions and 380 points. The contest ends on 20 Sept 2019. Yes, I want you all to go a little crazy(okay, not little. extreme. ) and work your ass off! 



**Challenge 07: TBD**

Coming soon. Sooner than you think!

## Course Resources

**Chapter 01: Fundamentals of Algorithms and Problem Solving**

We started off the course with motivation and [MATH FOUNDATIONS](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2019/blob/master/course-notes/1-math-foundations.pdf). The chapter is about understanding the fundamental problem types and analyzing efficiency with respect to time. [INTRODUCTION NOTES](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2019/blob/master/course-notes/1-intro-to-algorithms.pdf) cover the summary.  We did solve 23 problems using [EXERCISE HANDOUT](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2019/blob/master/course-notes/1-exercise-handout.pdf). 


**Chapter 02: Hashing and Hash Tables**

Hashing is a black box. The [INTRODUCTORY NOTES](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2019/blob/master/course-notes/2-hashing-intro.pdf) cover the evolution and popular hash algorithms. Refer to [HASHING EBOOK](https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/737188) for more details. Kindly note that two concepts were given for self-study as homework. Forget not to cover them. 


**Chapter 03: Graphs and Trees**

We realized that most real time scenarios are hierarchical and we need trees. Here is the introductory notes: [GRAPHS AND TREES](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2019/blob/master/course-notes/3-graphs-and-trees.pdf). Do refer class notes for more and various examples.
