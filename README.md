## Introduction
Twitter, a microblogging and informal communication administration, has reformed how we convey and collaborate on the web. With over 400 million dynamic clients, it has become a worldwide stage for continuous updates on news, legislative issues, diversion, and sports. Its effortlessness, convenience, and exceptional highlights like the 280-character limit, hashtags, and @mentions have made it an optimal stage for continuous correspondence and data scattering. Nonetheless, underneath its smooth point of interaction and compact tweets lies a perplexing embroidery of information designs and calculations that power its center functionalities. 

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and Algorithmic Problem Solving (APS) courses will serve as our theoretical foundations and practical expertise as we investigate the complexities of Twitter's services. This portfolio project expects to propose answers for genuine difficulties looked by Twitter, from advancing tweet suggestion calculations for upgraded client commitment to smoothing out satisfied balance processes. By saddling the power of cutting edge algorithmic strategies and imaginative information structures, we'll show how smart algorithmic critical thinking can refine client encounters, drive mechanical development, and sustain Twitter's situation as a forerunner in the web-based entertainment scene. Go along with me in this investigation as we overcome any issues between hypothetical information and viable application, uncovering the significant effect of information designs and calculations on current computerized correspondence.

## Objectives
* Analyze the data structures and algorithms that power Twitter's core functionalities.
* Apply theoretical knowledge gained from Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and Algorithmic Problem Solving (APS) courses to real-world challenges faced by Twitter.
* Demonstrate the transformative power of algorithms within Twitter's ecosystem.

### 2. **Detection of Trending Topic**

**Case:**
Utilizing effective data processing methods like DFS, Topological Sorting and Hashing to identify and track trending topics and hashtags over time. Traversing the graph of related tweets to identify trending hashtags.

**Challenges:** DFS: Finding the longest path in a tree (topology), discovering all the connected components in a graph, determining a cycle in a graph, finding a pattern in a grid, and locating a word in a crossword puzzle.
Topological sorting and Hashing: Effectively analyzing and counting hashtags in a large stream of tweets.

**Market Benefits:** Real-time trend identification, enhanced marketing strategies, and better engagement with trending content.

**Algorithms and Design Techniques:**
- **Topological sorting with hashing**
- **DFS**

### 3. **User Influencers Analysis**

**Dijkstra's Algorithm:** In Twitter's network infrastructure, the Dijkstra's algorithm can be used for locating influential users with a strong hold on network of followers that also aligns with the target audience. Understanding the connections, we can use shortest path to reach these influential users.

**Challenges:** Solving the problem of reaching a user with shortest path.

**Market Benefits:** Targeted influencer marketing, better ROI on promotional campaigns.

**Algorithms and Design Techniques:**
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Greedy approach, shortest path problem
